# Skewax
A browser based IDE for PBASIC and PBASIC based microcontrollers. Intended as an alternative to the Parallax IDE

# Acknoledgements

the compilation code for PBASIC is directly taken from [PBASIC TOKENIZER](https://github.com/parallaxinc/PBASIC-Tokenizer) on github. I would have referenced it as a node module but some edits had to be made so that it wouldn't throw errors when run directly through a browser.
